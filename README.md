# PillQC

A pill quality control dataset and associated visual inspection example.

## PillQC Data
This repository provides a dataset to demonstrate visual inspection and quality control related to pill manufacturing. The dataset contains three classes of images: normal pills which are free of defects, pills with dirt contamination, and pills with a chip defect.

<img src="images/dirt/dirt0001.jpg?raw=true"> 
<img src="images/chip/chip0001.jpg?raw=true"> 

## Anomaly Detection Example
This repository provides a MATLAB example as a Live Script which is based on the approach described in Explainable Deep One-Class Classification by Liznerski et al. The example shows how a deep anomaly detector can be trained on normal image data, together with a very small amount of anomaly data, to create a very effective pill anomaly detector. Running the included example requires MATLAB and the Deep Learning Toolbox.
